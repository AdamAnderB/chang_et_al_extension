Here is some starter code
```{r setup, include=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

#This part should not be changed- We will make this constant for every script we work on. You will need to put the data folder three levels up in the folder structure to work
```{r}
#this is where your data should be--- two folders out indicated by the ../ and ../
list.files("../../../data/cet_yas")

#creating the folder variable for our data folder
data_folder<-"../../../data/cet_yas/"

# word data
word_data<-read.csv(paste0(data_folder,"Chang_word_data_yk.csv"))

# et data
et_data<-read.csv(paste0(data_folder,"Chang_word_data_et_yk.csv"))
```

You can start to add your code from here: This will be really good practice for us creating a work flow so that we can collaborate through git. Feel free to copy the above for this---
```{r}
